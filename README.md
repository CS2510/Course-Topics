![Game Loop Banner Image](support/loop.jpg)

## 📺 Video Summary
- Many of the topics from this lecture can be found in [this video about game loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIxjCk4BCHE)

## 🔙Review
- What is the difference between the Box Model, SVG, and Canvas?
- What is the difference between the JS keyword `let` and `const`?

## Syllabus Review

## 💡New Idea: What is a computer game? (Review from previous day)
- In this class, a game is an enjoyable, interactive, visual simulation.
- How are we going to learn game programming?
  - Learn the math
  - Learn the architecture
  - Practice

## 💡New Idea: Repeated rendering
- We can manually call draw over and over to create an animation...
- ... and using a `for` loop causes the browser to crash.
- We need to find a way for the browser to call our code on a regular interval, which we can do with the `requestAnimationFrame` function
- requestAnimationFrame
  - 🔗Additional information:
    - [MDN website about requestAnimationFrame](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame)
    - [W3 Schools requestAnimationFrame](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_requestanimationframe.asp)

## 💡New Idea: Updating our game
- When we create a game, we want to strictly separate our game representation (model) from our draw code.
- Technically, people call this the separation of our model and view
- To do this correctly, we will have two functions, one called `update` that is in charge of update our game model and another called `draw` that updates the view
- Since we will call `update` and `draw` repeatedly, one after another, we put these in a function called `gameLoop`
- The game loop is the loop that will update and draw our game over and over again until the player is done.
  - Note that even though it is called a game *loop*, in this class, we call the game loop with `requestAnimationFrame`, not a formal loop structure. 
  - The reason for this is that in low-level languages where you have to build the threading for the game loop yourself, you traditionally do use a a loop strucuter
- gameLoop formalization 
  - 🔗Additional information: [A blog post about what a game loop is](https://m-abdullah-ramees0916.medium.com/the-game-loop-f6f5cb68c00)


## 💡New Idea: Vectors
- We can move the position of a game object into a variable, but in order to do that, we need to create a class that stores two numberic variables and threats them as one *thing*.
- What is a vector
  - 🔗Additional information: [A Wikipedia article about Vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(mathematics_and_physics))
- Vector Math: Adding Vectors
  - 🔗Additional information: [A website about adding vectors](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/VectorAddition.html)

## 💡New Idea: Physics (Math/Simulation)
- We can also use vectors to model the velocity of a game object
- Velocity
  - 🔗Additional information: [A Wikipedia article about Velocity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity)


## 💡New Idea: Classes in JS
- In order to create a Vector2 in javascript, we need to use classes
- classes in JS
  - 🔗Additional information: 
    - [MDN article about JS classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
    - [W3 Schools about JS classes](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_classes.asp)
- constructors in JS
  - 🔗Additional information:
    - [MDN article about constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor) 
    - [W3 Schools article about constructors](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_constructor_class.asp)
- class functions in JS
- fields in JS
  - 🔗Additional information: [MDN article about class fields](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/Public_class_fields)

## 👩‍💻Activity
- Create a simple moving game object simulation using the new Vector2 class. 

## 🤔To Think About
- Why is creative mode in Minecraft considered a game while a painting app is not?

## Ideas to explore on your own
- Can you make the code use arrays so that you don't need to manually call `lineTo` for each vertex?

## 📺 Video Summary
- Many of the topics from this lecture can be found in [this video about game loops](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIxjCk4BCHE)


## 📢Announcements
- Welcome to class
- Get a GitHub account

## 💡New Idea: Game Programming Courses at UNO
- Game Programming Course Layout:
  - ```mermaid
    graph LR
      CS2510["CS2510 Introduction to Game Programming"]-->CS3510["CS3510 Advanced Game Programming"]
      CS2510-->CS4620["CS4620 3D Computer Graphics"]
    ```
  - CS 2510, Introduction to Game Programming
    - Build a 2D game engine and a game from scratch in JavaScript
  - CS 3510, Advanced Game Programming
    - Build a 3D game using a commercial game engine (Unity) as a team
  - CS 4620, 3D Graphics
    - Understand how to create and drawing 3D assets
  
 ## 💡New Idea: Other Game Programming Resources at UNO 
 - Many students use their capstone to build something game-related
 - The art department has courses on developing 2D and 3D assets
 - Maverick Meadow in the UNO student organization focused on game development


## 🎉Course Goals
- We are going to build a 2D game engine and game in [JavaScript](javascript.info)
- So we can focus on programming, not gathering assets, our games in this class will not include:
  - Images (Including emoji)
  - Sounds
- I will be using the [VS Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in class, but you can use any IDE
- I will be using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code, but you don't have to.
- You can see some [examples of what previous students have done on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH9qo0GKu2iSlchbSeksN18S87gMIjHOg)

## 👩‍💻Activity
- Take what we have learned about drawing and draw something more advanced. Here are some ideas to try:
  - [Batman Logos](https://flowingdata.com/2012/12/24/evolution-of-batman-logo-1940-2012/)
  - ![Mickey Mouse Head](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRb5ejW-uLTRXHprPAMrWZUOFD1nWv7xpnvYw&s)

## 🤔To Think About
- Use an HTML canvas to draw the basic outline of a game you like. We can call this "blocking" out a game.
- Block out a game you enjoy using the basic drawing tools we use in class. Here are some examples of the instructor blocking out the original [Super Mario Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) game.
- Example code:
  - [Example code from the instructor showing how to block a game using arrays](https://github.com/CS2510/Day01.Drawing-Introduction/blob/main/02_blocking_a_game.html)
  - [Example code from the instructor showing how to block a game drawing "freehand" ](https://github.com/CS2510/Day01.Drawing-Introduction/blob/main/03_blocking_a_game_2.html)
