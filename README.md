## 💡New Idea: Game Programming Courses at UNO
- Game Programming Course Layout:
  - ```mermaid
    graph LR
      CS2510["CS2510 Introduction to Game Programming"]-->CS3510["CS3510 Advanced Game Programming"]
      CS2510-->CS4620["CS4620 3D Computer Graphics"]
    ```
  - CS 2510, Introduction to Game Programming
    - Build a 2D game engine and a game from scratch in JavaScript
  - CS 3510, Advanced Game Programming
    - Build a 3D game using a commercial game engine (Unity) as a team
  - CS 4620, 3D Graphics
    - Understand how to create and drawing 3D assets
  
 ## 💡New Idea: Other Game Programming Resources at UNO 
 - Many students use their capstone to build something game-related
 - The art department has courses on developing 2D and 3D assets
 - Maverick Meadow in the UNO student organization focused on game development


## 🎉Course Goals
- We are going to build a 2D game engine and game in [JavaScript](javascript.info)
- So we can focus on programming, not gathering assets, our games in this class will not include:
  - Images (Including emoji)
  - Sounds
- I will be using the [VS Code IDE](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in class, but you can use any IDE
- I will be using the [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) in VS Code, but you don't have to.
- You can see some [examples of what previous students have done on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLH9qo0GKu2iSlchbSeksN18S87gMIjHOg)

- Example code: [Code written by the instructor to show what we are learning](https://github.com/CS2510/Day01.Drawing-Introduction/blob/main/01_basic_drawing.html)



## 👩‍💻Activity
- Take what we have learned about drawing and draw something more advanced. Here are some ideas to try:
  - [Batman Logos](https://flowingdata.com/2012/12/24/evolution-of-batman-logo-1940-2012/)
  - ![Mickey Mouse Head](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRb5ejW-uLTRXHprPAMrWZUOFD1nWv7xpnvYw&s)

## 🤔To Think About
- Use an HTML canvas to draw the basic outline of a game you like. We can call this "blocking" out a game.
- Block out a game you enjoy using the basic drawing tools we use in class. Here are some examples of the instructor blocking out the original [Super Mario Bros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Bros.) game.
- Example code:
  - [Example code from the instructor showing how to block a game using arrays](https://github.com/CS2510/Day01.Drawing-Introduction/blob/main/02_blocking_a_game.html)
  - [Example code from the instructor showing how to block a game drawing "freehand" ](https://github.com/CS2510/Day01.Drawing-Introduction/blob/main/03_blocking_a_game_2.html)
